<h2>Documentation of Assignment 4</h2>
<br>
<pre>We have class named CodeReuse and it has three method and four attributes 
 (median,mean,variance,standardDeviation,sumOfSquare) and all attribute and method 
 are Static so it can be accessed by class name.</pre><br>
<h4>METHOD 1: sortDescending()</h4><br>
<pre>This method is static and it take array of double in parameter and sort array in
descending order.When this method is called it is necessary to send array of double 
in parameter and it is accessed by class and it has void return type.</pre><br>
<h4>METHOD 2: calculateStatistics()</h4><br>
 <pre>This method is static and it take array of double in parameter and calculate median ,mean ,
 variance ,standardDeviation and sumOfSquare of array and store in double array having in index[0] 
 it saves median ,index[1] it saves variance ,index[2] it saves standardDeviation and in index[3]
 it saves sumofsquare and it return an array of double.</pre><br>
<h4></h4>MEHTOD 3: matrixMultiplication()</h4>
<pre>This method is also static and it take two 2D array and three INTEGER inputs like one for rows ,one 
for column for matrix1 and one for matrix2 and rows are same.It returns 2D array which contain the result of matrix multiplication.</pre>
